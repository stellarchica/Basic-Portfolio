                <p>
                    She is currently the digital content editor at the <i><a href="https://www.sacurrent.com/" target="_blank">San Antonio Current</a></i>, the Alamo City's alt-weekly.
                    Her work has appeared in publications such as <i>BUST Magazine</i>'s website, We Are Mitu, (the now-defunct) SWTST.co, and Sexually Redefined.
